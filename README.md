robotBob
========

Arduino robot 'Bob'. Created on Jitter Hackathon (a part of Mobile Central Europe Conf)

Goes directly to strongest light source.

Uses Adafruit Motor Shield V2
Uses 3 photo resistors put on the front of robot.
Uses ultrasonic rangefinder.

The code is crappy because it was written during hackathon and the time was essential :D
